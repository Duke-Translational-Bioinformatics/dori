"The proposed risk score has been developed and validated in a white, middle-aged to elderly cohort. We note that the scheme may not be generalizable to younger individuals as we had too few young adults with AF. Additionally, it is well known that the incidence of AF differs in other ethnicities. Whereas other cardiovascular risk scores developed in Framingham perform well in independent cohorts, we acknowledge that our AF risk score must be validated, and potentially recalibrated in other ethnicities/races. Similarly, secular trends, with increasing incidence in AF over time has been reported. If the risk factors or incidence of AF change over time, the risk function may need to be recalibrated. We acknowledge that data were prospectively collected, but retrospectively analyzed. Critically, the external validity of the risk function has to be proven prospectively in independent samples."
