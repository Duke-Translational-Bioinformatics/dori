TRIPOD 1 (title)
2013 Risk Assessment for Incident Heart Failure in Individuals with Atrial Fibrillation

TRIPOD 6a (clearly defined outcome)
10-Year Risk of Incident Heart Failure (CUI ) GIVEN prevalent Atrial Fibrillation (CUI )


TRIPOD 7a (clearly defined predictors)
Predictors are Age, Body Mass Index, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, Diabetes, Significant Murmur (), Prevalent Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack), and Age times Prevalent Myocardial Infarction
Age times Prevalent Myocardial Infarction is calculated from inputs.

Age:quantitative:
BMI:quantitative:
Left Ventricular Hypertrophy:categorical:
diabetes:categorical: C1315719 C3171857 C0363687 C0363688 C3171856 C0359086
Valvular Heart Disease (Significant Murmur):categorical: C1963123 C0018824 C1854775 CL495106 C1968632 C1556324 C1556323 C1556322 C1556321 # unclear from paper what Grade of VHD is considered significant

Prevalent Myocardial Infarction:categorical:
Age times Prevalent Myocardial Infarction:quantitative: (no CUI)

TRIPOD 10 (statistical analysis methods)
Cox regression on predictors 
N.B. A more complete model was discussed in the paper, but has NOT been implemented.

TRIPOD 18 (limitations)
From the publication: "A user-friendly spreadsheet that incorporates the risk function may be downloaded from the Framingham Heart Study website. The range of values that can be entered is limited to that observed in the data set, e.g. 39-96 years of age. We truncated the upper risk estimate at >= 45% to avoid inaccuracies inherent in more
extreme observations."
